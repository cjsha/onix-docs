RHS2116 Headstage
#################

The RHS2116 Headstage is a serialized headstage for small animals with 32 channels which can independently be configured as stimulator outputs or amplifier inputs. The RHS2116 can be used with passive probes (e.g. silicon arrays, EEG/ECOG arrays, etc) using a 36-Channel Omnetics EIB. To learn how to use the RHS2116 headstage in software, refer to the :doc:`/Software Guide/Bonsai.ONIX/Nodes/RHS2116Device` software guide. For technical information, refer to the :doc:`/Hardware Guide/Datasheets/rhs2116` datasheet.

Data Link Serialization

For details on data serialization and headstage gateware, have a look at the
:ref:`serialization` page, which describes how coax headstages operate in
general terms. The RHS2116 headstage has the following coaxial link properties:

.. warning:: \*Do not exceed 4.35 VDC at the coaxial input to the headstage. Make
    sure you make this measurement at the headstage (see :ref:`measure_voltage`) to
    account for a potential voltage drop in the tether. Exceeding this voltage can
    permanently damage the headstage.

.. note:: Have a look at the :ref:`tethers` page for more details on micro-coax headstage tethers

Electrophysiology
*****************

RHS2116 headstage uses two 16-channel, BGA-packaged `Intan RHS2116
<https://intantech.com/>`__ bioamplifier chip. The chip is operated at a fixed
sampling rate of 30 kHz/channel. The RHS2116 provides 32 ephys channels which are exposed via a 36 pin `Omnetics connector <https://www.omnetics.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/A79025-001.pdf>`__ at the edge of the headstage and can record from most passive probes (e.g. tetrodes, silicon probe arrays, tungsten microwires, steel EEG wires, etc.).

Stimulation
===========

Stimulus trains can be parameterized in a similar way to the master-8 or pulse pal. For more information on this, refer to the :ref:`stimulator_configurator` section of the documentation.
